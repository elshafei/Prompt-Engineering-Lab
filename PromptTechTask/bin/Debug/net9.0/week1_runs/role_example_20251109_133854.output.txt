**Hey, squad!**  
I’m **Lila**, your go‑to college girl for all the *hacks* that make campus life feel like a breeze. Below are four sweet, legit tips that keep me chill, organized, and never stressed out. All the hacks are *on fleek* and totally #StudentLife. Ready? Let’s dive in!

### 1️⃣ **Morning “Glow‑Up” Routine – Start the Day Like a Boss**

First thing in the morning, I do a quick *power‑wake‑up* routine:  
- **Hydrate** – a glass of water with lemon to jumpstart my metabolism.  
- **Micro‑stretch** – 5 minutes of yoga or a quick walk around the dorm to get the blood flowing.  
- **Pre‑study playlist** – 10‑15 mins of lo‑fi beats or chill hits to get my brain in the right mood.  

This routine is a total game‑changer. I feel *on point* before I even hit my first class, so my focus stays *lit* all day. Plus, it saves time because I’m not scrambling to get ready at the last minute. Remember, no cap – a calm mind is the best hack for crushing assignments!

### 2️⃣ **“Digital Declutter” – Keep Your Devices & Notes Organized**

I’m all about that *organized vibe*, so I keep my digital life on fleek:  
- **One Notion Workspace** – I create a single Notion page where I store lecture notes, to‑do lists, and project timelines. The “Templates” feature makes it a breeze to copy a new page for every class.  
- **Folder Folders** – I have a “Semester 1” and “Semester 2” folder on my cloud drive. Every file gets a clear title (e.g., *Biology_2025_IntroToGenetics.pdf*).  
- **Daily Backup** – I set a reminder to sync my notes to the cloud every night. No more “Where did I save that?” moments.  

Trust me, when your files are *organized*, you save hours of scrolling and the mental space to actually *study* (not just find your notes). It’s like giving your brain a break so you can focus on the *content* that matters.

### 3️⃣ **“Meal‑Prep Magic” – Save Money & Time (and Keep Your Skin Glow)**  

I know *college food* can be a mix of cafeteria, vending machines, and the occasional takeout. Here’s my hack:  
- **Batch‑Cook** – Every Sunday, I cook 5–6 meals that last the week. Think chili, pasta salads, or sheet‑pan chicken. I portion them in glass containers, label with dates, and pop them in the fridge or freezer.  
- **Snack Swaps** – Replace pricey snack bars with homemade energy balls or Greek yogurt parfaits. They’re cheaper, tastier, and *no junk food vibes*.  
- **Smart Shopping** – I shop once a week at a local market or bulk store for staples (rice, beans, oats). The bulk buys *slim down my budget* and reduce the need for frequent trips.

This hack keeps me *fully fueled* through late‑night study sessions, and I never miss a class because I’m running out of snacks. Plus, I’m saving *dozens* of dollars a month – *boom, budget wins!*

### 4️⃣ **“Study Squad” – Team Up for Success (and Netflix)**  

Studying solo is fine, but a squad is *the real MVP* for motivation:  
- **Weekly Study Meet‑ups** – I set a recurring Zoom or campus study‑room session for each class. We share notes, ask each other tough questions, and keep each other accountable.  
- **Reward System** – After a focused hour of studying, we all get a mini‑break to binge‑watch a quick episode of a trending show. It’s the *perfect balance* of work and chill.  
- **Resource Exchange** – We swap helpful articles, past exams, and cheat sheets (within the school’s honor code). This way, nobody’s left scrambling for the same *material*.

Having a study squad means you’re never *facing the grind alone*. We hype each other up, share hacks, and keep our GPA on fleek. Plus, the friendships that bloom are *extra* rewarding!
