## 2. How to perform the search (manual steps)

| Step | What to do | Why it matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Paste the keyword string into a search engine or a scholarly database (Google, Bing, Factiva, or an academic repo). | Broad first‑pass retrieval. |
| 2 | Scan the first page of results for:  <br>• Official statistics (e.g., IEA, World Bank) <br>• Industry reports (BloombergNEF, McKinsey, Deloitte) <br>• Reputable news outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, Financial Times) | Prioritizes credibility. |
| 3 | Note the publication date. | Ensures the data is current. |
| 4 | Click on the most promising links, look for key figures (units sold, market share %, growth %). | Extract raw numbers. |
| 5 | If the numbers seem outdated, refine the query: add “2024”, “latest”, “Q4 2024”, or “2025 forecast”. | Narrows to newest releases. |
| 6 | If you hit a pay‑wall or a dead link, replace the source with a similar term: “report”, “white paper”, “analysis”. | Avoids dead ends. |
| 7 | Repeat until you find at least two independent sources that report the same headline figures. | Cross‑validation gives confidence. |

## 3. Sample search refinement cycle (illustrated)

| Cycle | Keyword string | What you found | Decision |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | `global EV market 2024 sales` | IEA 2024 report: 16 million EVs sold worldwide (≈ 0.7 % of total cars). | Need more detail on region. |
| 2 | `EV sales China 2024` | Reuters: China sold 3.5 million BEVs in 2024, up 28 %. | Great, but look for other regions. |
| 3 | `EV sales Europe 2023 2024` | Bloomberg: EU EV market share hit 13 % in 2024. | Good, but need 2025 forecast. |
| 4 | `EV market forecast 2024‑2030 IEA` | IEA forecast: global EV sales to reach 30 million by 2030. | Good source; cross‑check with BloombergNEF. |
| 5 | `BloombergNEF EV outlook 2025` | BloombergNEF: 45 % of new car sales will be EVs by 2025. | Highest‑confidence source. | ✅ |
