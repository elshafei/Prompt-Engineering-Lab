In the quiet corners of my mind,  
you stood—silently, unbroken, bright.  
Even when the world seemed blind,  
your hope never flickered, stayed in sight.

Now the hallway feels a little colder,  
yet in each breath I hear your laugh,  
the echo of your steadfast shoulder,  
I still miss you, and that’s that.
