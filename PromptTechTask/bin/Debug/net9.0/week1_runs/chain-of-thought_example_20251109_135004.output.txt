Sure, let’s walk through it step by step.  

1. **Start with the original price** of the meal (let’s call it **P**).  
2. **Apply the 10 % discount**.  
   - Discount amount = 10 % × P = 0.10 P.  
   - Discounted price = P – 0.10 P = 0.90 P.  
3. **Add the 7 % sales tax** to the discounted price.  
   - Tax amount = 7 % × (0.90 P) = 0.07 × 0.90 P = 0.063 P.  
   - Total price = discounted price + tax = 0.90 P + 0.063 P = **0.963 P**.  

So the final cost is **96.3 % of the original price**.  
In other words, you can calculate the total cost simply with the formula:

\[
\text{Total} = P \times 0.90 \times 1.07 = P \times 0.963
\]

**Example** – if the meal originally costs \$100:

- Discount = \$10 → \$90 remaining  
- Tax on \$90 = \$6.30  
- Final total = \$90 + \$6.30 = **\$96.30**  

That’s the step‑by‑step process!
